/**
 This represents a measure that is part of a repeat. This is not one of the original measures that
 will be repeated. This represents a measure that is a repeat of one of the original measures to
 be repeated.
 
 i.e. If we want to repeat measure A 2 times, you would have

    | A, repeated A, repeated A |

 This structure represents those repeated measures "repeated A", so that they can be differentiated from the
 original measure "A".
 
 - Note: Look at `MeasureRepeat.expand()` to see how this is used.
